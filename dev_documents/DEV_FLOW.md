# AC-CDD Internal Development Flow

This document explains the internal architecture, logic, and resources used by the AC-CDD agent system.
It is designed to provide complete transparency into "who is doing what" during the development lifecycle.

## 🏗 System Architecture

AC-CDD utilizes a **Hybrid Agent System** orchestrated by **LangGraph**. It combines the autonomous capabilities of Google's Jules API with the precision editing and auditing power of the `aider` CLI.

### Role & Tool Mapping

| Role | Tool / API | Model Configuration | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Architect** | **Google Jules API** | Standard Jules Model | Analyzes requirements (`ALL_SPEC.md`), designs architecture, and generates `SPEC.md` and `UAT.md`. Operates in a text-only mode (no file execution). |
| **Coder (Initial)** | **Google Jules API** | Standard Jules Model | Performs the **Initial Implementation** (Iteration 0). Has access to file system and terminal tools to scaffold the project from scratch. |
| **Coder (Fixer)** | **aider (CLI)** | `SMART_MODEL` (e.g., Claude 3.5 Sonnet) | Handles **Refinement & Repair** (Iteration > 0). Uses `aider`'s superior code editing capabilities to apply fixes based on audit feedback. |
| **Auditor** | **aider (CLI)** | `FAST_MODEL` (e.g., Gemini 2.0 Flash) | Strictly reviews code in **Read-Only** mode. Leverages `aider`'s Repository Map to understand context and detect issues across the codebase. |

## 🔄 Detailed Workflow Logic

The system operates in two main phases: **Architecture** and **Coding**.

### 1. Architect Phase (`gen-cycles`)
*   **Input**: `dev_documents/ALL_SPEC.md` (User Requirements)
*   **Process**:
    1.  **JulesClient** initiates a session with the Architect Persona (`ARCHITECT_INSTRUCTION.md`).
    2.  Jules analyzes requirements and outputs design documents in a strict `FILENAME:` format.
    3.  The client parses these blocks and writes them to disk.
*   **Output**: `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CYCLE{xx}/SPEC.md`, `CYCLE{xx}/UAT.md`.

### 2. Coder Phase (`run-cycle --auto`)
This phase uses a **Fixed Iteration Loop** (default: 3 rounds) to force continuous improvement.

```

#### Step-by-Step Logic
1.  **Iteration 1 (Creation)**:
    *   **Agent**: **Jules**.
    *   **Action**: Reads `SPEC.md` and implements the core logic from scratch.
2.  **Verification**:
    *   **Tests**: `pytest` runs to capture logs.
    *   **UAT**: The `QA Analyst` agent (Internal Gemini) evaluates test logs against `UAT.md`.
3.  **Strict Audit**:
    *   **Agent**: **Aider** (Read-Only).
    *   **Logic**: Reviews the code against `AUDITOR_INSTRUCTION.md`. Even if the code works, it *must* find improvements (optimization, refactoring, robustness).
4.  **Iteration 2+ (Refinement)**:
    *   **Agent**: **Aider** (Fixer).
    *   **Action**: Takes the Audit Feedback and applies precise code edits.
5.  **Completion**:
    *   The loop continues until `MAX_ITERATIONS` (defined in config) is reached.
    *   The final state is committed to the feature branch.

## 🔍 Deep Dive: Core Mechanisms

### Feature 1: The RAD Pipeline (`gen-cycles`)
The "Rapid Application Design" pipeline transforms raw text into structured engineering artifacts without human intervention.
*   **Process**: The `ArchitectGraph` invokes the **Jules Architect**.
*   **Parsing Logic**: `JulesClient` monitors the agent's output stream in real-time. It uses a robust regex (`FILENAME:\s*(.*?)\n\s*` ````) to detect file blocks generated by the LLM.
*   **Result**: This allows the Architect to "write" complex file trees (specs, diagrams, plans) simply by outputting text, effectively bridging the gap between natural language and file systems.

### Feature 2: The Audit Loop (The "Committee")
Instead of a simple "Pass/Fail" check, AC-CDD enforces a **Forced Iteration Loop** to guarantee code maturity.
*   **Mechanism**: The `CoderGraph` does not allow merging until `MAX_ITERATIONS` are completed.
*   **The Cycle**:
    1.  **Implementation**: Jules scaffolds the feature.
    2.  **Audit**: `aider` (Fast Model) reads the code context and applies the `AUDITOR_INSTRUCTION.md` rules. It generates a list of "Critical Issues" and "Optimization Suggestions".
    3.  **Refinement**: `aider` (Smart Model) consumes this feedback and applies surgical edits to the codebase.
*   **Why it works**: By separating the "Auditor" (Critic) from the "Fixer" (Editor) and forcing multiple rounds, the system eliminates the common "lazy agent" problem where AI generates bare-minimum code.

### Feature 3: UAT Gatekeeper
The **UAT Gatekeeper** ensures that the code actually does what the user asked for.
*   **Input**: `test_logs` (captured from `pytest`) and `UAT.md` (generated by the Architect).
*   **Evaluation**: The `uat_evaluate_node` invokes a QA Analyst Agent (Gemini Flash).
*   **Logic**: The agent parses the Gherkin-style scenarios in `UAT.md` and cross-references them with the execution logs. If a scenario passes technically (green test) but fails functionally (wrong behavior), the cycle is flagged as **FAILED**.

## 🤖 Configuration & Resources

The system's behavior is controlled via environment variables and configuration files.

### Environment Variables (`.env`)

| Variable | Usage | Recommended Value |
|---|---|---|
| `JULES_API_KEY` | Authentication for Google Jules API (Architect/Initial Coder). | `required` |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Primary key for Gemini Models (Auditor/QA). | `required` |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Primary key for Claude Models (Fixer via Aider). | `required` |
| `SMART_MODEL` | Model ID for **Fixer** (Aider). High capability required. | `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` |
| `FAST_MODEL` | Model ID for **Auditor** (Aider). Speed & Context required. | `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` |

### Configuration Files

*   **`ac_cdd_config.py`**: Central Python configuration.
    *   `MAX_ITERATIONS`: Controls the number of refinement loops (Default: 3).
    *   `AiderConfig`: Maps `SMART_MODEL`/`FAST_MODEL` to `aider` arguments.
*   **`dev_documents/templates/`**: System Prompts.
    *   `ARCHITECT_INSTRUCTION.md`: Prompts for Jules (Architect).
    *   `CODER_INSTRUCTION.md`: Prompts for Jules (Initial Coder).
    *   `AUDITOR_INSTRUCTION.md`: Prompts for Aider (Auditor). **Must remain Strict.**

## Why this Architecture?

*   **Jules** is excellent at "0 to 1" creation and understanding broad project goals, making it ideal for the Architect and Initial Coder roles.
*   **Aider** is the SOTA (State of the Art) tool for applying diffs and editing existing code, making it superior for the "Fixer" role where precise refactoring is needed.
*   **LangGraph** acts as the supervisor, ensuring the process doesn't stop at the first "pass" but forces the code to undergo rigorous refinement cycles.
